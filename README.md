# My-First-Cyber-Security-Page
This will be my first webpage site as I am learning Github and how to be a part of the cyber security world. 

I wanted to learn about cyber scrurity in my early 20's, I am currently typing this at the age of 23, I was drawn to the didgital world at first from video games. I learned from my physical jobs that if I can really learn how to operate systems with my hands and mind, and make more without hurting myself, then this would be my goto job.

I learned early on that the whole "Nerd in his moms basement" was such a styriotype that most folks don't fit this, from the homebodies to the tech nomades who turn the world into thier home. We all come with different and new flavors to enjoy. I learned that if I can see past the whole cyber world, I could join it as one of the few that fight back against these new hacking attempts placed by threat actors. I learned that older folks who had no tech experience or even some younger folks could fall prey to the threat actors who would abuse their position in the world to steal and take the very life savings of the last generation, the very money that prevents them from needing to work till they perish.
